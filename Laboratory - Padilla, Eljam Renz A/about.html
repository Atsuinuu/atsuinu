                            This blog is based on the k-drama series "When the Weather is Fine".
                            The male lead had a private blog in which he posts literary pieces as his privare diary.
                            But the blog was not available online in real life and was only shown in the TV series.
                            This is just a recreation of that blog and I do not claim ownership of the said literary articles.

                        <p> 
                            Hye-Won (Park Min-Young) is an ordinary woman with good character. 
                            She has played the cello since she was a child.
                            Hye-Won began her social life with her ability to play the cello, but, during that time, she was hurt emotionally by others. 
                            Due to that, Hye-Won does not trust people and she has closed her heart to others.
                            Hye-Won becomes sick and tired of her life in Seoul and decides to move back to her hometown Bookhyun Village.
                            There, Hye-Won meets Eun-Seob (Seo Kang-Joon). He runs the bookshop “Goodnight Bookstore.” Eun-Seob’s daily life is simple.
                            He wakes up and drinks coffee, reads a book and writes on his blog. Eun-Seob’s daily life begins to change after he meets Hye-Won.
